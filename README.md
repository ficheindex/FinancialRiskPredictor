Financial risk prediction is essential in the finance sector.
Machine learning methods are in broad use for automated
potential risk detection, reducing labor costs.
The existing algorithms are somewhat outdated, especially taking into account the quick evolution of generative AI and
large language models(LLMs), plus the lack of a unified and open-sourced
financial benchmark has slowed down related research.
Addressing these issues, we propose FinPT and FinBench: the former is a
novel method for financial risk prediction, conducting Profile Tuning
on large pretrained foundation models, the latter offers
quality datasets on financial risks such as default, fraud, and churn.
In FinPT, we integrate the financial tabular data into the predefined ins
