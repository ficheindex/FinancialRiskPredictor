class LocalActivationUnit(nn.Module):
    """The LocalActivationUnit used in DIN with which the representation of
        user interests varies adaptively given different candidate items.

    Input shape
        - A list of two 3D tensor with shape:  ``(batch_size, 1, embedding_size)`` and ``(batch_size, T, embedding_size)``

    Output shape
        - 3D tensor with shape: ``(batch_size, T, 1)``.

    Arguments
        - **hidden_units**:list of positive integer, the attention net layer number and units in each layer.

        - **activation**: Activation function to use in attention net.

        - **l2_reg**: float between 0 and 1. L2 regularizer strength applied to the kernel weights matrix of attention net.

        - **dropout_rate**: float in [0,1). Fraction of the units to dropout in attention net.

        - **use_bn**: bool. Whether use BatchNormalization before activation or not in attention net.

        - **seed**: A Python integer to use as rand
