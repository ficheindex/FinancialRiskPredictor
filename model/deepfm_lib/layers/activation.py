    """The Data Adaptive Activation Function in DIN,which can be viewed as a generalization of PReLu and can adaptively adjust the rectified point according to distribution of input data.

    Input shape:
        - 2 dims: [batch_size, embedding_size(features)]
        - 3 dims: [batch_size, num_features, embedding_size(features)]

    Output shape:
        - Same shape as input.
